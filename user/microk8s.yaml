# See https://microk8s.io/docs/troubleshooting#heading--common-issues ,
# "My pods can't reach the internet or each other (but my MicroK8s host machine can)..."
#
# If you need your microk8s cluster to access the Internet, localops provides script
# microk8s/ufw-allow-microk8s.sh to help you configure your firewall. However, localops
# *DOES NOT* execute it, as this might be a security issue. Please review and customize
# it as you see fit, given your use cases.
#
# Even after correctly configuring your firewall, you may experience connectivity issues,
# after rebooting. Running "microk8s stop" before shutting down should prevent them from
# happening and, even if they do, "microk8s start" and "microk8s stop" should fix them.
