# localops

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks to manage installation and configuration of local environments. Each branch holds [Ansible playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html) for different distros.

You may be interested in this project if:

1. You constantly need to set up computers for your own use, with different configurations each time (my personal motivation);
2. You manage several distinct computer configurations, and are just plain tired of doing so manually, having to remember every little detail and difference each one has (come to think of it, my personal motivation, too).

Currently supported distros:

* [Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/): branch [ubuntu_bionic_beaver](https://github.com/gasrios/localops/tree/ubuntu_bionic_beaver).
