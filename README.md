# localops

Local environment software installation and configuration tool that uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

You may be interested in this project if:

1. You constantly need to set up computers for your own use, with different configurations each time (my personal motivation);
1. You manage several distinct computer configurations, and are just plain tired of doing so manually, having to remember every little detail and difference each one has (come to think of it, my personal motivation, too).

## Tested distros:

* [Debian 12 (bookworm)](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/)
* [Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/)

If you would like to add support to your favorite distro, check [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/gasrios/localops/blob/debian/bootstrap.sh#L70) out.

## Installation

**Note:** Unless you know me personally, or work with me, you should not execute any instructions in this section before double checking them and the contents of script [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/gasrios/localops/blob/master/bootstrap.sh). For all you know, I may not even exist, and this project is a trojan someone created to install a rootkit in your computer.

After you are satisfied verifying everything, run the following command, first for a user than can `sudo`, or root, then for each user you want to be able to use localops:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasrios/localops/master/bootstrap.sh | bash -
```

If asked, inform your password.

## Using localops

After installation, you can install additional softwares from the command line by running the following command:

`localops ${PATH_TO_PLAYBOOK}`

A list of useful playbooks can be found at [localops-playbooks](https://github.com/gasrios/localops-playbooks).
